# Sample website 

This is a simple sample website made for mastering git. i used [*Learn enough git to become dangerous*](https://www.learnenough.com/course/learn_enough_git/frontmatter) which I highly reccomend!

Being able to use Git to track changes in my projects, back up data, share my work with others, and collaborate
with programmers and other users of Git is a must.
